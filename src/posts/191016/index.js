    text: `I came across a fascinating guide that, through simple iterations, demonstrated how a web page could be 
    improved by applying simple CSS adjustments. As a developer rather than designer, it is interesting to see the 
    powerful impact that seemingly small changes have. Especially fascinating is the gradual enhancement that is 
    displayed when the various discussed changes are applied.<br/>
    <br/>
    I went ahead and applied the changes to the page, and am pleased to say that it made a noticeable difference. 
    If you, like me, aren't well versed in the world of web design, maybe the guide guide will help you too:<br/>
